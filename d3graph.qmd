## Variable Importance from Random Forest

This bar chart displays the variable importance (%IncMSE) from the
random forest model. **Brand** and **ZoomTele** emerge as the most
influential features. The importance values reflect how much model error
increases when a variable is permuted, with higher bars representing
more critical features.\

## Partial Dependence Plot for ZoomTele

This partial dependence plot shows the marginal effect of **ZoomTele**
on predicted price. At low values (especially under 50), ZoomTele has a
strong positive impact on price. If the level go beyond that, the effect
plateaus, suggesting diminishing returns at higher zoom levels.\

## Partial Dependence Plots for Important Variables

This panel of PDPs illustrates how each key variable influences the
predicted price: - **EffectivePixels** and **MaxResolution** exhibit a
sharp positive effect after a threshold; - **ReleaseDate** has a
negative effect on **Price** - **Weight** demonstrates a non-linear
trend with an inflection point.

These plots reveal individual feature effects on the model output.\

## 2D Partial Dependence Plot – ZoomTele vs. EffectivePixels

This bivariate PDP visualizes the interaction between **ZoomTele** and
**EffectivePixels**. The top-left corner (low values for both) shows the
highest predicted prices, whereas most of the grid reflects lower
predictions. This suggests a strong interaction between the two
variables in shaping model predictions.\

## SHAP Values for the First Test Observation

This SHAP summary plot explains the contribution of each feature to the
prediction for the first test observation. **Brand**, **MacroFocus**,
and **ReleaseDate** contributed positively, while **ZoomTele** had a
large negative impact. SHAP values provide local interpretation and
highlight which features drive individual predictions.\

## Variable Importance Stability Under Different Train/Test Splits

This plot shows how variable importance changes across different
train/test splits (20%, 70%, 90%). Features like **Brand** and
**Dimensions** remain consistently important, while others like
**Storage** and **ZoomWide** show greater variability, suggesting model
sensitivity to training data allocation.\

## Variable Importance Stability Across Seeds

The heat map presents variable importance values across different random
seeds. Features like **Brand** and **ZoomTele** remain consistently
important, demonstrating robustness, whereas **MacroFocus** and
**Storage** exhibit more fluctuation between seeds, indicating potential
model instability.\

## Linear Regression vs Random Forest

This comparative chart illustrates feature importance across linear
regression and random forest models. While linear regression heavily
weights brand dummy variables (e.g., Brand Kodak, Brand Leica), random
forest assigns more importance to continuous features like
**EffectivePixels**, **ZoomTele**, and **Brand**. This highlights the
non-linear model’s ability to capture complex feature interactions.
